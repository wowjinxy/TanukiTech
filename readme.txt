   ```python
   from twitchio.ext import commands

   metadata = {
       "name": "My Custom Plugin",
       "version": "1.0",
       "author": "YourName",
       "description": "Description of your plugin."
   }

   class MyPlugin(commands.Cog):
       def __init__(self, bot):
           self.bot = bot

       @commands.command(name="mycommand")
       async def my_command(self, ctx):
           await ctx.send("This is my custom command!")

   def setup(bot):
       bot.add_cog(MyPlugin(bot))
   ```

3. Restart the bot or reload plugins with `F5` to activate your new plugin.
